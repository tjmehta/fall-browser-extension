# Fall (browser-extension)
### Have you ever found yourself with more browser windows open than you could to deal with?
Fall is a browser extension that prevents you from getting into that situation. Fall will 
automatically close untouched browser tabs over time and keep a history of your closed tabs. 
This way Fall let's you focus on what's important. Closed browser tabs can be easily recovered
from a popover that is only a click away. Fall even allows you to restore tabs that you have
manually closed. Check out the screenshots below:
